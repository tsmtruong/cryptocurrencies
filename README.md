# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze a dataset from many alternative cryptocurrencies to spot trends that make a firm or person want to invest in them. The current problem with cryptocurrencies is that the most common ones, like bitcoin or ethereum, are becoming too expensive and unobtainable for the common public. That being said, I will be using unsupervised machine learning to see if we can spot any trends that result in opportunities of these altcoins.
